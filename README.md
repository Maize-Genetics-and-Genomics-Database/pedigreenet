# PedNet
The MaizeGDB Pedigree Viewer is developed to display pedigree relationships between maize lines in a network representation. The Viewer is based on a pedigree network of 5487 maize lines that are currently available in the MaizeGDB Stock Pages. The tool allows the user to apply a number of filters, select or upload their own breeding relationships, center a pedigree network on a maize line, and display the shortest path(s) between two maize lines on the pedigree network.

The tool can currently be accessed here: https://rho.maizegdb.org/breeders_toolbox
