# PedNet
The MaizeGDB Pedigree Viewer is developed to display pedigree relationships between maize lines in a network representation. The Viewer is based on a pedigree network of 5487 maize lines that are currently available in the MaizeGDB Stock Pages. The tool allows the user to apply a number of filters, select or upload their own breeding relationships, center a pedigree network on a maize line, and display the shortest path(s) between two maize lines on the pedigree network.

The tool can currently be accessed here: https://www.maizegdb.org/breeders_toolbox

Please note that installing a working instance of this tool will require some code changes because it was developed using an internal templating language not included in this repository. Relevant portions of the code to change are specified as comments in the source files.
